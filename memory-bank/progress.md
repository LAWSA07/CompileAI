# Progress: LAWSA Compiler

## What Works
- Full support for C primitive types, structs, unions, enums, typedefs, bitfields, flexible arrays, pointer arithmetic, struct assignment, and float/double.
- Unified parser and robust type system.
- Comprehensive semantic analysis and error recovery (multiple errors per run).
- Minimal and advanced preprocessor features: macros, includes, conditionals, function-like macros.
- Extensive positive and negative test suite, all passing.
- Modular, maintainable codebase with clear build system.

## What's Left to Build
- Preprocessor: multi-argument function-like macros, macro hygiene, robust file inclusion, all standard directives.
- Standard library stubs and integration.
- Codegen optimizations (peephole, dead code elimination, register allocation).
- Improved error reporting and user experience (context, suggestions, source tracking).
- More edge-case and conformance tests (including fuzzing).

## Current Status
- Advanced "alpha" stage: robust, feature-rich, and reliable for a large subset of C.
- All major features and tests are working as intended.
- Ready for further preprocessor, optimization, and UX improvements.

## Known Issues
- Preprocessor: limited macro hygiene and multi-argument macro support.
- No standard library stubs yet; some C programs may not link/run without system libc.
- Optimizations and advanced error reporting are planned but not yet implemented.
