# Active Context: LAWSA Cursor-Like IDE

## Current Work Focus
- **TRANSFORMING PROJECT**: Converting LAWSA from educational compiler to Cursor-like IDE with memory and LLM integration
- **LLM Integration**: Implementing Qwen Coder model from OpenRouter API for AI-powered development
- **Memory System**: Building persistent memory system for context-aware AI assistance
- **IDE Enhancement**: Expanding Electron app with advanced AI features

## Recent Changes
- Project scope shifted from pure educational compiler to AI-powered development environment
- Identified need for memory system and LLM integration architecture
- Planning integration of OpenRouter API with Qwen Coder model
- Preparing to enhance existing Electron IDE with Cursor-like capabilities

## Next Steps
1. **Memory System Implementation**
   - Design persistent memory storage for project context
   - Implement memory retrieval and update mechanisms
   - Create memory indexing for efficient context access

2. **LLM Integration Architecture**
   - Set up OpenRouter API integration
   - Implement Qwen Coder model communication
   - Create prompt engineering for compiler-aware assistance

3. **IDE Enhancement**
   - Extend existing Electron app with memory-aware features
   - Add AI-powered code completion and suggestions
   - Implement context-aware refactoring and optimization

4. **Compiler-AI Integration**
   - Connect LLM with compiler internals for better suggestions
   - Add AI-powered error diagnosis and fixes
   - Implement intelligent code generation assistance

## Active Decisions
- Use OpenRouter API with Qwen Coder model for LLM capabilities
- Maintain existing compiler functionality while adding AI features
- Build memory system that understands compiler context and project structure
- Create seamless integration between AI assistance and compiler operations
