# Active Context: LAWSA Compiler

## Current Work Focus
- Completing and refining the preprocessor (multi-argument macros, macro hygiene, robust includes, full directive support).
- Laying groundwork for standard library stubs and integration.
- Planning for codegen optimizations and improved error/UX.

## Recent Changes
- Type system expanded to all C primitives, structs/unions/enums, typedefs, bitfields, flexible arrays, pointer arithmetic, struct assignment, float/double.
- Parser refactored for unified type/declarator handling.
- Robust semantic analysis and error recovery implemented.
- Minimal and advanced preprocessor features added (macros, includes, conditionals, function-like macros).
- Comprehensive positive/negative test suite created and passing.
- Build system and codebase refactored for consistency and maintainability.

## Next Steps
1. Complete preprocessor (multi-arg macros, macro hygiene, robust includes, all directives).
2. Add standard library stubs and integration.
3. Implement codegen optimizations.
4. Improve error reporting and user experience.
5. Expand and maintain test suite for all new features and bugfixes.

## Active Decisions
- Prioritize preprocessor completion before optimizations and standard library.
- Maintain educational clarity and extensibility in all code changes.
- Update Memory Bank and documentation after each major milestone.
